### Datasets
All information about datasets is directly available in `data/`. We use open-source datasets, and their citations are available in the same path. You don't need to download them againâ€”just unpack a few of them. You can unpack them using our [unpack script](#unpacking).

Learn more about our dataset **genCry** and others by visiting the [Datasets](data/) page.


### Unpacking
To unpack all datasets, you can use the unpacking script.  
If you want to simply unpack the datasets, run the script without any parameters:
```bash
python notebooks/scr/unpacking.py
```
Add the `-f` or `--filter` flag to enable dataset filtering for the main dataset:
```bash
python notebooks/scr/unpacking.py -f
```
