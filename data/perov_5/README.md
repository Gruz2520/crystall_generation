# Perov-5

Perov-5 contains 18,928 perovskite materials that share a similar structure but have different chemical compositions. There are 56 elements present, and all materials contain 5 atoms in the unit cell. All materials from the original dataset are included. All materials are at local energy minima after DFT relaxation. A significant portion of the materials is thermodynamically unstable, meaning they will decompose into nearby phases and cannot be synthesized.

## Contents of the dataset

Perovskite is a class of materials that share a similar structure and have the general chemical formula ABX3. The ideal perovskites have a cubic structure, where the site A atom sits at a corner position, the site B atom sits at a body centered position and site X atoms sit at face centered positions. Most structures in Perov-5 will signficantly deviate from the ideal cubic structure because the distorted structure has a lower energy.
