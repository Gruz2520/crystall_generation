# MP-20

MP-20 comprises 45,231 general inorganic materials that vary in both structure and composition. It contains 89 elements, and the materials feature between 1 and 20 atoms in their unit cells. MP-20 encompasses nearly all experimentally identified materials with no more than 20 atoms in their unit cells, all of which are synthesizable through experimental methods. Each material is positioned at a local energy minimum after undergoing DFT relaxation.

## Contents of the dataset

MP-20 includes nearly all experimentally stable materials sourced from the Materials Project (Jain et al., 2013) that have unit cells with a maximum of 20 atoms. We exclusively include materials originating from the ICSD (Belsky et al., 2002) to ensure their experimental stability, and these materials account for the vast majority of experimentally recognized materials with 20 or fewer atoms in their unit cells.
