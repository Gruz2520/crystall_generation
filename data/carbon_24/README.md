# Carbon_24

Carbon_24 consists of 10k carbon materials that share the same composition but exhibit different structures. It encompasses 1 element, and the materials contain between 6 and 24 atoms in their unit cells. All 10,153 structures are situated at a local energy minimum following DFT relaxation, with the most stable configuration being diamond at 10 GPa. The other structures, while thermodynamically unstable, may still be kinetically stable.

## Dataset contents

Carbon_24 features a variety of carbon structures generated through ab initio random structure searching (AIRSS) (Pickard & Needs, 2006; 2011) conducted at 10 GPa.
