# mpts_52

MPTS_52 (Materials_Project_Time_Split_52) contains 40476 stable crystalls. All compounds is restricted to experimentally verified with no more then 52 sites. All materials are experimentally synthesizable. All materials are at local energy minimum after DFT relaxation

## Contents of the dataset

MPTS-52 includes almost all experimentally stable materials from the Materials Project (Jain et al., 2013) with unit cells including at most 52 atoms. Dataset includes all materials from original database without any filters except only radioactive elements.
